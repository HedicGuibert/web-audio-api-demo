# Welcome !

This project is a small demo website that plays music with the Javascript Web Audio API.
It simply aims at giving an idea of what you can do with the API.

This website will parse tablatures taken from https://pianoletternotes.blogspot.com/ and play them in your browser.
If you want to get the notes of the songs, you may get them as JSON. An article is being written on how to use these notes.

Some songs may not sound good at all. Some may even produce *very* loud and unpleasant notes. There is not much we can do about it,
but because of this you should use this website (and the API as a whole) with caution and lower the volume.
We preselected a few songs that play quite well so that you can try it easily.
